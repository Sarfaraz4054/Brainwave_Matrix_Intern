# Fake and Real News Detection

## Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes the subject distribution and title patterns of fake and real news articles. It uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud to generate insights from two datasets: `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`. The analysis focuses on:
- Visualizing subject distributions for fake and real news.
- Generating word clouds for the titles of fake and real news articles.

## Project Features

Data Analysis**: Explore subject distribution in fake and real news datasets.
Data Visualization**: 
Bar plots of subject distribution.
Word clouds showcasing the most frequent words in the news titles.
Interactive Insights**: Overlay exact counts on bar charts for better interpretability.

 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

 `pandas`
 `matplotlib`
 `seaborn`
 `wordcloud`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

## Datasets

- **Fake.csv**: Contains fake news articles with fields such as `title` and `subject`.
- **True.csv**: Contains real news articles with fields such as `title` and `subject`.

Ensure these datasets are in the same directory as the project file.

---

## Visualizations

1. **Subject Distribution**:
   - Bar plots for fake and real news articles with subject-wise counts.
   - Helps in understanding the dominant topics in fake and real news.

2. **Word Clouds**:
   - Visual representation of the most frequent words in the titles of fake and real news articles.

## How to Run

1. Place the files `Fake.csv`, `True.csv`, and the script (`Fake_and_Real_News_detection.ipynb`) in the same directory.
2. Open the script in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. Run the script to generate the visualizations.

## Future Improvements

- Add a classification model to distinguish between fake and real news articles.
- Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to explore content beyond titles.
